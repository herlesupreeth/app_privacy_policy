    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
                  Supreeth Herle built the CoIMS app as
                  a Free app. This app is provided by
                  Supreeth Herle at no cost and is intended for use as
                  is.
                </p> <p>
                  This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                  policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                  Information if anyone decided to use my app.
                </p> <p>
                  If you choose to use my app, then you agree to
                  the collection and use of information in relation to this
                  policy. I DO NOT collect any Personal Information in the app.
                </p> <p><strong>Permissions, Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
                  For backwards compatability with Android 8.0 and 8.1 devices, 
                  I use the READ_PHONE_STATE permission. This permission allows me to
                  access current Telephony subscriptions, Carrier Configurations on the phone and also to trigger
                  changes to Carrier Configurations. 
                  However, this permission is not required on Android 9+ devices.
                  The app itself does not have any mechanism to store any data and neither
                  any mechanism to send any data.
                  The information that I request is used just to display information on your 
                  device and is not collected by me in any way.
                </p> <!----> <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p> <p>
                  I DO NOT collect any logs.
                </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                  commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                  to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                  stored on your device's internal memory.
                </p> <p>
                  This app does not use these “cookies” explicitly.
                </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
                  This app does not contain links to other sites except for links to 
                  this privacy policy and terms and conditions.
                </p> <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p> <p>
                  This app do not address anyone under the age of 13 explicitly.
                  I do not knowingly collect personally
                  identifiable information from children under 13.
                  If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                  personal information, please contact me so that
                  I will be able to do necessary actions.
                </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
                  I may update our Privacy Policy from
                  time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                  periodically for any changes. I will
                  notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
                  this page.
                </p> <p>This policy is effective as of 2020-04-22</p> <p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p> <p>
                  If you have any questions or suggestions about my
                  Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me at herlesupreeth@gmail.com.
